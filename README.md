This is a script for Tampermonkey.

"I just don't want to keep clicking 'Laureate Poet' over and over again."

It is designed for those tedious loops of "Go → page changes → Try Again → page changes → Go → ...".

You can set it to stop based on a predefined number of loops or a target QualityValue.
If no QualityValue is detected, the script will simply continue running without checking.

Feedback and bug reports are very welcome!

Tampermonkey用的脚本

“我只是不想再点击桂冠诗人了”

适用于一些愚蠢的循环点击“Go-页面变化-Try again-页面变化-Go-...”

可以根据开始前设定的循环次数或QualityValue结束，如果无QualityValue会忽略直接往下跑。
