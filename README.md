This is a script for Tampermonkey.

"I just don't want to keep clicking 'Laureate Poet' over and over again."

It is designed for those tedious loops of "Go → page changes → Try Again → page changes → Go → ...".

You can set it to stop based on a predefined number of loops or a target QualityValue.
If no QualityValue is detected, the script will simply continue running without checking.
