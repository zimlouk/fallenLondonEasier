"I just don't want to click on the Poet Laureate anymore."
This applies to some foolish loops of clicking "Go-page changes-Try again-page changes-Go-..."
It can end based on the number of cycles or QualityValue set before starting.

“我只是不想再点击桂冠诗人了”
适用于一些愚蠢的循环点击“Go-页面变化-Try again-页面变化-Go-...”
可以根据开始前设定的循环次数或QualityValue结束
